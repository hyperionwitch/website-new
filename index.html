                                <p class="update-text">At last! The <a href="./cosplay.html">Cosplay</a> page has been added to the website!</p> I'm not necessarily <em>in love</em> with the formatting right now, but mostly I wanted to get it posted and I can massage it later.  For now, it has the photos of my most recent cosplays that have nice photoshoots, and I may(??) add info like construction details or awards later, if that's a thing people would be interested in?  And I also included a bonus section with pictures of my (christ) 20 year history of cosplays, just for fun.</p>
                                <p class="update-text">Also! There's a new image in the Illustration section to view (it's also in the Tev/Dren section, perhaps unsurprisingly).  It's soft and pink and cozy, if that's a vibe you're looking for.</p>
                                <p class="update-text">That's all for now—I am, in fact, slowly picking away at another comic, and I've got multiple cosplays in the works, so there will be updates coming ssssoooonish.</p>

                                <p class="update-text">Li'l baby update.  As suggested in the last post, there's a new comic up that's a direct followup to the last one.  You can find it in the Comics section, "Downtime in Balmora pt. II".  I do love some good yearning, and that comic has been kinda overdue for a remake for a long time now.</p>

                                <p class="update-text">Happy New Year!  Well, Fraught New Year in many ways, I suppose, but here we are.  I can't say I didn't <em>personally</em> have a pretty good 2024, all things considered, but whoo boy is the state of my country...a time right now!  Hope everybody is staying safe and finding people and things they love to keep them going.</p>
                                <p class="update-text">Meanwhile, there's a new Tev/Dren comic in the Comics section, "Downtime in Balmora pt. I".  It's a fluffy little prequel to an existing comic that I'm planning on remaking—if I were smarter, I would have started the prequel earlier so I could have that remake ready for my birthday, as is tradition, but seeing as I didn't and now that's three days from now, that is <em>certainly</em> not happening.  Ah well, serves me right for setting imaginary rules.</p>
                                <p class="update-text">In other miscellaneous updates, I'm <em>still</em> (very slowly) working on the Cosplay section, so I'm sure there'll be another update when that rolls through, and I also swapped my Twitter link for my Bluesky link, as I'm trying to move over there completely at this point.</p>

                                <p class="update-text">Tiny update, a few of the site's quirks have been fixed—switching between illustrations, comics, and reference slides should all work a lot better than they used to.  Mobile pull to refresh is still not working on Chrome, and mucking with it has not borne fruit yet, but it seems to work by default on Firefox, so...that's a plus?</p>

                                <p class="update-text">Another quick update here, there's a new Tev/Dren comic in the Comics section, "Cavern of the Incarnate".</p>
                                <p class="update-text">I'm also (very slowly) working on a Cosplay section for the site—I've been taking it more seriously lately, and I finally have a pretty good collection of cosplay photoshoots, so it feels like the right time.</p>
                                <p class="update-text">As for other updates still hanging, hopefully I will have the motivation to pick at those soon.  Thanks for your patience!</p>

Though I personally had a lot of Bumps In The Road in 2023, shall we say, I'm also rather happy with how it shook out creatively, so I guess it's sort of a wash in the end?  I hope it went better for you!  Either way, it's time for a new year and a new start, so let's keep on truckin'~</p>
                                <p class="update-text">And on that note, let's start off the year with an update to my About page—I just started a Ko-fi membership, so I added that link over yonder if you want to check it out.  There's also more info on my Tumblr <a class="link" href="https://hyperionwitch-art.tumblr.com/post/738707767583522816/headshot-stream-changes">here</a>, for those of you who attend the monthly streams and want to know what's up and how the membership relates to it!</p>
                                <p class="update-text">That's all from me for now—I've got a handful of comic/illustration/cosplay irons already in the fire, so hopefully there will be updates there soon, as well.  Cheers!</p>

                                <p class="update-text">Happy Friday the 13th!  There's a new Tev/Dren comic up in the Comics section, "Arkngthand".  Yes, it's a redo of an older comic (a combination of two, actually), no it's not my birthday and my joke with myself is I can only post comic redos on my birthday, yes I've decided I can post it anyway because Dren's birthday was on the 10th.</p>
                                <p class="update-text">Other website updates are coming, I've just been taking a break to get some art and cosplay done, handle some family stuff, and adopt a new cat.  Exciting, and also stressful!  But we'll get there.</p>

I'm still working out how to handle comic transcripts, and there are a few bugs I'm chewing on, so if you've tried to access the site on mobile and noticed weirdness with swiping down to reload (turns out I have to implement that manually, so currently it's not doing anything at all) or with using the left/right buttons on the Tev/Dren references, I'm working on wrangling those into working order.</p>
